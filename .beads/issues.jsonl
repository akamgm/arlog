{"id":"arlog-01u","title":"Feed navigation times out even when feed API succeeds with 0 events","description":"arlog reports a timeout error trying to fetch the feed, but observing Playwright shows the feed API call actually succeeds — it just returns a feedcount of 0 (no events to fetch). The page never reaches networkidle because it keeps waiting for feed data that won't come, eventually hitting the 60s timeout. Need to handle the case where the feed API responds successfully but with 0 results, instead of treating it as a navigation failure.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"smart.sand7808@fastmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:45:35.145296-05:00","created_by":"Michael Morrissey","updated_at":"2026-02-14T17:46:28.044095-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-14T17:46:28.044095-05:00","close_reason":"Replaced networkidle with domcontentloaded + explicit feed API response polling"}
